##   Tail Your Files Like a Pro with Node.js (Tail) 

This repository provides a Node.js implementation of the classic `tail` command with `websockets` layer on top of it, staying true to its original name: **Tail**. 

**What is Tail?**

Tail empowers you to effectively monitor the contents of a file in real-time, just like the familiar `tail` command in Linux. 

**Why Tail?**

- **Node.js Power:** Leverages the power of Node.js for a smooth and efficient experience.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Keeps you updated with the latest changes in your files as they occur.
- **Familiarity:** Offers a familiar interface for those accustomed to the traditional `tail` command.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chinmayacharya19/Tail.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd Tail
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Tail:**

   ```bash
   node main.js <filename> [options]
   ```

   - `<filename>`: Replace this with the path to the file you want to monitor.
   - `[options]`: (Optional) You can specify additional options like:
      - `-n <number>`: Follow the last `<number>` lines of the file.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
node tail.js server.log -n 10
```

This command will tail the `server.log` file and display the last 10 lines, updating as new data is written to the log.
